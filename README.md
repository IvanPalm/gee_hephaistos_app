### The mith of Vulcan

Vulcan is a Roman God whose father was Jupiter, king of the Gods, and his mother was Juno, queen of the Gods. It was believed that with such parents he would be powerful and handsome. As a baby, Vulcan was instead small and ugly. His face was red and distorted.
Juno was so horrified at the sight of Vulcan that she threw him off the top of Mount Olympus when he was just a baby. It is said he fell for a day and a night and then plunged into the sea. When he hit the water, it broke one of his legs. It never healed properly, and it was noticeable when Vulcan walked. He went deep into the sea. Thetis was a sea nymph and found Vulcan. She took him to her underwater home and raised him as her son.
